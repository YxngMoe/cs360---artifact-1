Milestone 2 - Software Design/Engineering (artifact 1)


The selected artifact is a Java-based mobile application created as part of the CS360 course around a semester ago. This course focused on developing a full-stack mobile application using simple methods to create a fully working application.

This artifact's placement in my ePortfolio is justified by its application to software design and engineering. It demonstrates my expertise in full-stack application development, namely Java programming and mobile development. The artifact was enhanced by including validation and small changes to increase usability, particularly in the backend functionality.

With this update, I hoped to achieve the course objectives outlined in Module One, which included showing expertise in software design and engineering concepts. The upgrades to the outcome-coverage plans included improvements to the application's usability and security features.

Reflecting on the process of improving the artifact, I gained important lessons about user validation and backend development. The hurdles were guaranteeing interoperability across several devices and striking a balance between introducing new functionality and keeping the application's interface simple. Overall, the experience gave a good understanding of software design and engineering fundamentals.

All changes were made in MainActivity.Java file because thats where the validation enhancements needed to be made and for the design to better and more robust.
